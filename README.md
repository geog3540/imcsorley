### geog3540/imcsorley - Isaac McSorley

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Geographic Visualization class portfolio! This repository showcases the various projects and assignments I have completed as part of the course, highlighting my skills and understanding of geographic data visualization techniques and tools. The primary objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to create visually compelling, interactive, and informative maps and visualizations using a range of geospatial datasets.

# Overview
Throughout the course, I have used a combination of open-source GIS software, web mapping libraries, and programming languages to create diverse geographic visualizations. This repository is organized into several folders, each containing a specific project or assignment, complete with source code, data files, and any necessary documentation.
