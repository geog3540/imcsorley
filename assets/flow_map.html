      <b> Justification of your flow map design</b> <br />
      <br />
      1. Flow map symbology: The flow map symbology chosen for this assignment
      is justified based on the following aspects: a. Point symbols (nodes):
      Green color was chosen for the nodes as it contrasts well with the dark
      grey canvas background, making them easily visible. Proportional scaling
      for the nodes allows for a clear visual representation of the relative
      importance of each location in terms of bike-sharing activity. b. Flow
      symbols: The curved half arrow style was chosen for the flows as it
      provides a visually appealing representation of the movement direction and
      avoids overlap with the nodes. Natural breaks classification helps in
      simplifying the representation of data and makes it easier to identify
      patterns in flows and the colors stand out easier. It does make it a
      little more confusing because it is not simple easy numbers on the legend,
      but it allows the data to be distributed and to visually see which areas
      have more/less flows. c. Background choropleth map: The dark grey canvas
      background was selected as it provides a neutral and unobtrusive backdrop
      that allows the flow lines and nodes to stand out, enhancing the
      readability of the flow map. <br /><br />
      2. Flow map elements: The flow map includes a title of "Top 50 Chicago
      bikeshare flows." I have also included a proper legend to explain the
      color scheme, node scaling, and flow classifications. Additional elements
      included the north arrow and the size comparison 1000m <br /><br />
      3. Fill and outline colors: The yellow-green-blue color scheme chosen for
      the flows allows for an easy and intuitive understanding of the number of
      flows corresponding to each break in the data. The green color for the
      nodes contrasts well with the dark background and complements the color
      scheme of the flows.<br /><br />
      4. Visual clutter reduction: Limiting the visual clutter produced by
      overlapping flow lines is achieved by carefully adjusting the "show top
      flows" option on Flow Symbology, focusing only on the most significant
      flows to highlight the most important patterns and trends. I chose to only
      show the top 25 flows. I believe this is enough to get the understanding
      of the top flows in the area while not cluttering the map and making it
      harder to concentrate on individual flows.<br /><br /><br />
      <b> Interpretation of Flow Patterns:</b> <br /><br />
      1. Places that attract/receive the most flows: The downtown Loop area of
      Chicago and the Navy Pier have the highest number of flows (238),
      indicating that these areas are significant hubs for bikeshare activity.
      <br /><br />
      2. Places that send the most flows: The south side of Chicago sends most
      of the flows north to the Loop area, while the north end of Chicago sends
      flows south.<br /><br />
      3. General direction of flows: One key thing to notice is there are no top
      flows going east or west. The flows are primarily in a north-south
      direction, reflecting the geography of the city and the distribution of
      bikeshare stations.<br /><br />
      4. Flow patterns in relation to location characteristics: The flow
      patterns indicate that the majority of bikeshare activity is concentrated
      in and around the downtown Loop area, where businesses and traffic are
      denser. Additionally, flows on the east side of Chicago often cross the
      river at a similar location, suggesting the presence of key bikeshare
      routes or bridges that facilitate movement between the two sides of the
      city. Another factor is number of bikes in each location. After living in
      downtown Chicago last summer, I found that there are many more Divvy bikes
      located in the downtown area (The Loop, River North). The flow map
      effectively demonstrates how these location characteristics influence the
      flow patterns observed in the data.
